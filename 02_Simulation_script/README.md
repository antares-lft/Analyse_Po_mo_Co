Here are the different steps to run a simulation:
1. Create the fitness landscape.
- Run the AAFitnessLandscape script with the desired number of codons
- Run the Julia script for the desired population size
2. Run the simulation:
- slim_bash: modify the desired paths and parameters
- slim_parse
- Population_splitting_codon
- the Newick file containing the species and population sizes
- tree.py is used to process the Newick file
Then launch on the cluster
